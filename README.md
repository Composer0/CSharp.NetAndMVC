C# Coding Challenges
Palindrome Checker Folder and More

Learned how to use the MVC design model and apply it to my writing in C#. My first project in C# was to create a Palindrome Applicaiton. This was followed by FizzBuzz and then my loan calculator. As an added challenge to myself I learned how to route these applcaitons to each other through different view folders that were initially created to help me organize the created apps. At this time all three apps are visible on the same web app which was deployed on the Azure hosting service. Due to Azure hosting being fairly expensive the app was migrated to Railway.

This application uses the MVC design model and applied it to my writing in C#. These projects primarily operate using 'For' loops to filter through the data to check and modify the values. Within this applciation is Palindrome Checker, FizzBuzz Finder, and my Loan Calculator.
